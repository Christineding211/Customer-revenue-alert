## 🔍 Key Features

### 2. Customer Trend Diagnostics
- Visualises individual customer revenue trends with linear regression and 3-month moving averages, helping stakeholders quickly assess whether a client is recovering, stagnating, or deteriorating.

### 3. Revenue Heatmap for Group Monitoring
- A monthly heatmap shows the average revenue across each decline group, helping to identify periods when high-risk groups experience significant drops in income.

### 4. Business Insights
- The system provides per-customer analytics such as initial vs latest revenue and average monthly decline rate, enabling account managers to take timely action to reduce churn risk.
